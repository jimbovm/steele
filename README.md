# Steele

Steele is intended to be a toy Java Virtual Machine (and who knows, perhaps a serious one eventually) implemented in Rust. It was begun as an excuse to both learn Rust and explore JVM internals.

At present, Steele features functionality for parsing Java class files.

Steele is both a reference to Rust and to Guy Steele, one of the inventors of the Java platform.
